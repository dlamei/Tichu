# Lama

This is a simple C++ implementation of the game "Lama" by AMIGO. You can read the game's rules [here](https://www.amigo.games/content/ap/rule/19420--031-2019-Lama_Manual_002_LAYOUT[1].pdf). The implementation features a client/server architecture for multiplayer scenarios.
It uses [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) for the GUI, [sockpp](https://github.com/fpagliughi/sockpp) for the network interface, [rapidjson](https://rapidjson.org/md_doc_tutorial.html) for object serialization, and [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for the unit tests.

This is a template project for the students of the course Software Engineering. In order to adapt this template to a different game, you will only need knowledge in wxWidgets and maybe about some basic functions of rapidjson to serialize certain data types. By sticking to the template you won't need to dig into sockpp at all.

## Code Reuse
#### You may reuse as much of this code as you want!
We even encourage it! Therefore, we also encourage you to **read through this documentation, as it explains the way this template project works and how it can be adapted to different use cases.** At the very least, we highly encourage your team to at least use the `server_network_manager` and `clientNetworkManager` to simplify (TCP) communication between client and server.

## 1. Compile instructions
This project only works on UNIX systems (Linux / MacOS). We recommend using [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/#download), as it offers the easiest way to setup wxWidgets. Therefore, we explain installation only for Ubuntu systems. The following was tested on a Ubuntu 20.4 system, but should also work for earlier versions of Ubuntu.

**Note:** If you create a virtual machine, we recommend to give the virtual machine at least 12GB of (dynamic) harddrive space (CLion and wxWidgets need quite a lot of space).

### 1.1 Prepare OS Environment

#### Ubuntu 20.4
The OS should already have git installed in order to download this repository. If not, you can use: 
`sudo apt-get install git`

Execute the following commands in a console:
1. `sudo apt-get update`
2. `sudo apt-get install build-essential` followed by `sudo reboot`
3. if on virtual machine : install guest-additions (https://askubuntu.com/questions/22743/how-do-i-install-guest-additions-in-a-virtualbox-vm) and then `sudo reboot`
4. `sudo snap install clion --classic` this installs the latest stable CLion version
5. `sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev` this installs wxWidgets (GUI library used in this project)


### 1.2 Compile Code
1. Open Clion
2. Click `File > Open...` and there select the **/sockpp** folder of this project
3. Click `Build > Build all in 'Debug'`
4. Wait until sockpp is compiled (from now on you never have to touch sockpp again ;))
5. Click `File > Open...` select the **/cse-lama-example-project** folder
6. Click `Build > Build all in 'Debug'`
7. Wait until Lama-server, Lama-client and Lama-tests are compiled

## 2. Run the Game
1. Open a console in the project folder, navigate into "cmake-build-debug" `cd cmake-build-debug`
2. Run server `./Lama-server`
3. In new consoles run as many clients as you want players `./Lama-client`

## 3. Run the Unit Tests
1. CLion should automatically create a Google Test configuration Lama-tests which will run all tests. See [Google Test run/debug configurationï»¿](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/creating-google-test-run-debug-configuration-for-test.html#gtest-config) for more information.
2. From the list on the main toolbar, select the configuration Lama-tests.
3. Click ![run](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2021.1/artwork.studio.icons.shell.toolbar.run.svg) or press `Shift+F10`.
   
You can run individual tests or test suites by opening the corresponding file in the **/unit-tests** folder and clicking ![run](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2021.1/artwork.studio.icons.shell.toolbar.run.svg) next to the test method or class. For more information on testing in CLion read the [documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/performing-tests.html).

## 4. Code Documentation
You don't need to look at the **/sockpp**, **/rapidjson** or **/googletest** folder, as they simply contain 3rd party code that should not be changed.

The code for the game can be found in **/src**, where it is separated into following folders:
- **/client** contains only code that is used on the client side (e.g. UI, sending messages)
- **/common** contains code that is shared between server and client.
    - **/exceptions** contains the exception class used on server and client side. You don't need to change anything in here (unless you want to rename the LamaException class ;))
    - **/game_state** contains the `game_state` that is synchronized between client and server. We use the [conditional pre-compile directive](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/) LAMA_SERVER to enable certain parts of the code only on the server side. Namely, these are the state update functions, as they should only happen on the server. The client simply reflects the current game state as sent by the server without modifying it directly. 
    - **/network** contains all the messages that are being passed between client and server. We use the conditional pre-compile directive LAMA_SERVER to enable execution of a `client_request` on the server side (through the function `execute()`). Similarly, we use the LAMA_CLIENT pre-compile directive to make `server_repsonses` only executable on the client side (through the function `Process()`) .
    - **/serialization** contains base classes for serializing `game_state`, `client_request` and `server_response` objects. **Serialization** is the process of transforming an object instance into a string that can be sent over a network, where the receiver deserializes it, i.e. recreates the object from the string. If you are interested, [read me on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization).
- **/server** contains only code that is relevant for the server (e.g. player management, game instance management, receiving messages)

The **/asset** folder stores all the images that are being used to render the GUI.

The **/unit-tests** folder contains all unit tests, which validate the correct behaviour of the functions written in the source code of the game. 

### 4.1 Overview

First off, this project consists of a **server** and a **client**, each with their own main.cpp file. 

The client renders the GUI that is presented to the player, whereas the server is a console application without a user interface. Every action a player performs in the client application (for example playing a card) is sent as a formatted message to the server application, which processes the request.   
- If the **player's move was valid**, the server will update the game state (e.g. move a card from the player's hand to the discard pile) and broadcast this new game state to all players of the game. Whenever the client application receives a game state update, it will re-render the GUI accordingly and allow new interactions.   
- If the **move was invalid**, the game state will not be updated and only the requesting player will get a response containing the error message. 

### 4.2 Network Interface
Everything that is passed between client and server are objects of type `client_request` and `server_response`. Since the underlying network protocol works with TCP, these `client_request` and `server_response` objects are transformed into a **[JSON](https://wiki.selfhtml.org/wiki/JSON) string**, which can then be sent byte by byte over the network. The receiving end reads the JSON string and constructs an object of type `client_request` resp. `server_response` that reflects the exact parameters that are specified in the JSON string. This process is known as **serialization** (object to string) and **deserialization** (string to object). If you want to read more about serialization, [read me on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization).

![client-server-diagram](./docs/img/client-server-diagram.png?raw=true)

#### 4.2.1 Serialization & Deserialization of messages
Both, the `client_request` and `server_response` base classes, implement the abstract class `serializable` with its `write_into_json(...)` function. It allows to serialize the object instance into a JSON string. Additionally, they have a static function `from_json(...)`, which allows creating an object instance from a JSON string.

```cpp
// All request types of your imlementation
// IMPORTANT: Add your own types here (and remove unused ones)
enum RequestType {
    join_game,
    start_game,
    play_card,
    draw_card,
    fold,
};

class client_request : public serializable {
protected:
    RequestType _type;   // stores the type of request, such that the receiving end knows how to deserialize it
    std::string _req_id; // unique id of this request
    std::string _player_id; // id of the player sending the request
    std::string _game_id;   // id of the game this request is for

    ...
private:
    // for deserializing RequestType (contains mappings from string to RequestType)
    // IMPORTANT: Add mapping for your own RequestTypes to this unordered_map
    static const std::unordered_map<std::string, RequestType> _string_to_request_type;
    
    // for serializing RequestType (contains mappings from RequestType to string)
    // IMPORTANT: Add mapping for your own RequestTypes to this unordered_map
    static const std::unordered_map<RequestType, std::string> _request_type_to_string;

public:
    // DESERIALIZATION: Attempts to create the specific client_request from the provided json.
    static client_request* from_json(const rapidjson::Value& json);

    // SERIALIZATION: Serializes the client_request into a json object that can be sent over the network
    virtual void write_into_json(rapidjson::Value& json, rapidjson::Document::AllocatorType& allocator) const override;

// Code that should only exist on the server side (conditional preprocessor directive)
#ifdef LAMA_SERVER
    // Executes the client_request (only on server)
    // This function is automatically invoked by the server_network_manager when a valid client_request (this) arrives.
    virtual server_response* execute() = 0;
#endif
};
```

##### Serialization

When you implement your own specializations of `client_request` (and `server_response`, if necessary) you will have to implement the `write_into_json(...)` functions yourself. Your subclass always has to call the `write_into_json(...)` function of its base-class, such that the parameters of the base-class are written into the JSON document: 

Here is the **base-class** implementation:
```cpp
// Implementation in the base-class client_request
void client_request::write_into_json(rapidjson::Value &json,
                                     rapidjson::MemoryPoolAllocator<rapidjson::CrtAllocator> &allocator) const {
    // Look up string value of this client_request's RequestType and store it in the json document
    rapidjson::Value type_val(_request_type_to_string.at(this->_type).c_str(), allocator);
    json.AddMember("type", type_val, allocator);

    // Save player_id in the JSON document
    rapidjson::Value player_id_val(_player_id.c_str(), allocator);
    json.AddMember("player_id", player_id_val, allocator);

    // Save game_id in the JSON document
    rapidjson::Value game_id_val(_game_id.c_str(), allocator);
    json.AddMember("game_id", game_id_val, allocator);
    ...
}
```
And here is the **subclass** implementation (for the `play_card_request` class), where an additional field `_card_id` is serialized.
```cpp
// Implementation in the subclass play_card_request 
void play_card_request::write_into_json(rapidjson::Value &json,
                                        rapidjson::MemoryPoolAllocator<rapidjson::CrtAllocator> &allocator) const {
    // IMPORTANT: call base-class, such that the parameters of the base-class are written into the 'json' variable
    client_request::write_into_json(json, allocator);

    // Add parameters to the JSON that are unique to the play_card_request
    rapidjson::Value card_id_val(_card_id.c_str(), allocator);
    json.AddMember("card_id", card_id_val,allocator);
}
```

##### Deserialization

The deserialization of `client_request` JSONs always goes through the `from_json(...)` function of the `client_request` class. In this function, the "type" field, stored in the JSON, is inspected to determine, which subclass should be called to perform the deserialization: 

```cpp
if (json.HasMember("type") && json["type"].IsString()) {
        // Get the RequestType stored as a string in the JSON
        const std::string type = json["type"].GetString();
        // Lookup the actual RequestType per string from a pre-defined unordered_map
        const RequestType request_type = client_request::_string_to_request_type.at(type);

        // Call the correct from_json() specialization
        if (request_type == RequestType::play_card) {
            return play_card_request::from_json(json);
        }
        else if (request_type == RequestType::draw_card) {
            return draw_card_request::from_json(json);
        }
        else if (...) {
            ...
        } else {
            throw LamaException("Encountered unknown ClientRequest type " + type);
        }
    }
    throw LamaException("Could not determine type of ClientRequest. JSON was:\n" + json_utils::to_string(&json));
```

Therefore, when you implement your own `client_request` subclasses, remember to add a new element into the `RequestType` enum to define your new request type. You will also have to add an entry for this new RequestType in the two unordered_maps `_string_to_request_type`, resp. `_request_type_to_string` in the `client_request` base-class. Once this is done, you can add a check for your new `RequestType` element in the `from_json(...)` function of the `client_request` base-class and call the specialized `from_json(...)` function of your subclass from there. 

Also, don't forget to set the correct `RequestType` in the public constructor of your new `client_request` subclass, here examplified at the `play_card_request` class:

```cpp
// Public constructor
play_card_request::play_card_request(std::string game_id, std::string player_id, std::string card_id)
        : client_request(client_request::create_base_class_properties(  // call base-class constructor
                                                    RequestType::play_card, // IMPORTANT: set the RequestType of your subclass
                                                    uuid_generator::generate_uuid_v4(), 
                                                    player_id, 
                                                    game_id) ),
        _card_id(card_id)   // set subclass specific parameters
{ }
```

The deserialization in your subclass will look something like this:

```cpp
// private constructor for deserialization
play_card_request::play_card_request(client_request::base_class_properties props, std::string card_id) :
        client_request(props),  // call base-class constructor
        _card_id(card_id)   // set subclass specific parameters
{ }

// Deserialization
play_card_request* play_card_request::from_json(const rapidjson::Value& json) {
    // extract base-class properties from the json
    base_class_properties props = client_request::extract_base_class_properties(json);

    // get subclass specific properties
    if (json.HasMember("card_id")) {
        // invoke deserialization constructor
        return new play_card_request(props, json["card_id"].GetString());
    } else {
        throw LamaException("Could not find 'card_id' in play_card_request");
    }
}
```

There are plenty of examples of subclasses in the network/requests folder, where you can see how the serialization/deserialization scheme works.

#### 4.2.2 Sending messages
#### Client -> Server:
All you have to do is use the static class `ClientNetworkManager` on the client side and then invoke its `sendRequest(const client_request& request)` function with the `client_request` that you want to send. The server's response will arrive as an object of type `request_response` and the `ClientNetworkManager` will invoke the `Process()` function of that `request_response` object automatically.

#### Server -> Client:
If you look at the signature of the `execute()` function of the `client_request`, you can see that it returns a pointer to an object of type `request_response` (a subclass of `server_response`). When implementing the `execute()` function of your `client_request` subclass, you have to return an object of type `request_response` with all parameters you want to send. This return value will then automatically be sent over the network to the requesting client. 

If the `client_request` caused an update of the game_state you should also update all other players of that game about the game_state change. This happens in the `game_instance` class, here examplified at the case where a `start_game_request` calls the `start_game(...)` function on the respective `game_instance` on the server side:

```cpp
bool game_instance::start_game(player* player, std::string &err) {
    modification_lock.lock();   // make sure only one request can modify the game_state at a time

    // Try to start the game
    if (_game_state->start_game(err)) { 
        // create a full_state_response (subclass of server_response) with the full game_state inside
        full_state_response state_update_msg = full_state_response(this->get_id(), *_game_state);
        // send new game_state to all other players
        server_network_manager::broadcast_message(state_update_msg, _game_state->get_players(), player);

        modification_lock.unlock(); // allow other threads to modify the game_state
        return true;
    }
    modification_lock.unlock();
    return false;
}
```

#### 4.2.3 Debugging Messages

By default, the server (specifically, the server_network_manager) will print every valid message that it receives to the console. In order for this to work in your project as well, you have to make sure that your CMake file contains a line, where the preprocessor variable PRINT_NETWORK_MESSAGES is defined for your server executable. 

```
target_compile_definitions(Lama-server PRIVATE PRINT_NETWORK_MESSAGES=1)
```

If a wrongly formatted message arrives at the server, it will print an error message with the received message string to the console, no matter if PRINT_NETWORK_MESSAGES is defined or not. 

If you want to manually print one of your serialized messages (or any other serialized object for that matter), you can use the helper function `json_utils::to_string(const rapidjson::Value* json)` as follows. 

```cpp
#include "src/common/serialization/json_utils.h"
#include "rapidjson/include/rapidjson/document.h"

...
// Create a request to serialize
join_game_request* req = new join_game_request(player->get_id(), player->get_player_name());

// serialize the request object
rapidjson::Document* req_json = req->to_json();

// print serialization to the console.
std::cout << json_utils::to_string(req_json) << std::endl;
```


### 4.3 Game State

The `game_state` class stores all parameters that are required to represent the game on the client (resp. server) side. In order to synchronize this `game_state` among all players, the `game_state` can also be **serialized** and **deserialized**. If a `client_request` was successfully executed on the server, then the `request_response` that is sent to back to the client contains a serialized version of the updated `game_state`. All other players receive the updated `game_state` at the same time through a `full_state_response`.

To serialize the `game_state`, the same `write_into_json(...)` function is used as for the `client_request`. 

```cpp
class game_state : public unique_serializable {
private:
    // Properties
    std::vector<player*> _players;
    draw_pile* _draw_pile;
    discard_pile* _discard_pile;
    serializable_value<bool>* _is_started;
    serializable_value<bool>* _is_finished;
    serializable_value<int>* _round_number;
    serializable_value<int>* _current_player_idx;
    serializable_value<int>* _starting_player_idx;

    // deserialization constructor
    game_state(
            std::string id,
            draw_pile* draw_pile,
            discard_pile* discard_pile,
            std::vector<player*>& players,
            serializable_value<bool>* is_started,
            serializable_value<bool>* is_finished,
            serializable_value<int>* current_player_idx,
            serializable_value<int>* round_number,
            serializable_value<int>* starting_player_idx);

public:
    game_state();

    ...
    // SERIALIZATION
    virtual void write_into_json(rapidjson::Value& json, rapidjson::Document::AllocatorType& allocator) const override;
    // DESERIALIZATION
    static game_state* from_json(const rapidjson::Value& json);
};
```

The `game_state` inherits from `unique_serializable`, which essentially requires the `write_into_json()` function and adds a unique `id` to the object, such that it can be uniquely identified. Similarly, each parameter nested inside the `game_state` (e.g. players, draw_pile, etc.) also inherit from `unique_serializable` and therefore have their own `id` and serialization, resp. deserialization functions.

On the client side, the new `game_state` is then passed to the `updateGameState(game_state*)` function of the `GameController` class, which performs a redraw of the GUI.

Since you will have to add your own properties to the `game_state` class (and probably create other classes that inherit from `unique_serializable` to add to your game_state), we want to shortly elaborate how the serialization and deserialization works for subclasses of `unique_serializable`. It's very similar to the `client_request` class discussed earlier. Here is how the `write_into_json(...)` function is implemented in the `game_state` class of Lama. **Don't be shocked by the lengthy code. It's only a lot of repetition for each class property** :

```cpp
void game_state::write_into_json(rapidjson::Value &json,
                                 rapidjson::MemoryPoolAllocator<rapidjson::CrtAllocator> &allocator) const {
    // call base-class to write id and object name into the json
    unique_serializable::write_into_json(json, allocator);

    // write all properties of this game_state instance into the JSON
    rapidjson::Value is_finished_val(rapidjson::kObjectType);   // create an empty rapidjson::Value that can hold an ObjectType
    _is_finished->write_into_json(is_finished_val, allocator);  // write class property '_is_finished' into the created rapidjson::Value
    json.AddMember("is_finished", is_finished_val, allocator);  // add the rapidjson::Value 'is_finished_val' to the game_state json

    rapidjson::Value is_started_val(rapidjson::kObjectType);
    _is_started->write_into_json(is_started_val, allocator);
    json.AddMember("is_started", is_started_val, allocator);

    rapidjson::Value current_player_idx_val(rapidjson::kObjectType);
    _current_player_idx->write_into_json(current_player_idx_val, allocator);
    json.AddMember("current_player_idx", current_player_idx_val, allocator);

    rapidjson::Value starting_player_idx_val(rapidjson::kObjectType);
    _starting_player_idx->write_into_json(starting_player_idx_val, allocator);
    json.AddMember("starting_player_idx", starting_player_idx_val, allocator);

    rapidjson::Value round_number_val(rapidjson::kObjectType);
    _round_number->write_into_json(round_number_val, allocator);
    json.AddMember("round_number", round_number_val, allocator);

    rapidjson::Value draw_pile_val(rapidjson::kObjectType);
    _draw_pile->write_into_json(draw_pile_val, allocator);
    json.AddMember("draw_pile", draw_pile_val, allocator);

    rapidjson::Value discard_pile_val(rapidjson::kObjectType);
    _discard_pile->write_into_json(discard_pile_val, allocator);
    json.AddMember("discard_pile", discard_pile_val, allocator);

    // Special helper function to serialize vector of pointers
    // The pointers inside the vector have to inherit from serializable (or unique_serializable)
    json.AddMember("players", vector_utils::serialize_vector(_players, allocator), allocator);
}
```

For **deserialization**, the `from_json(...)` function is used, which is implemented as follows:

```cpp
// DESERIALIZATION CONSTRUCTOR receives pointers for all its properties and stores them
game_state::game_state(std::string id, draw_pile *draw_pile, discard_pile *discard_pile,
                       std::vector<player *> &players, serializable_value<bool> *is_started,
                       serializable_value<bool> *is_finished, serializable_value<int> *current_player_idx,
                       serializable_value<int>* round_number, serializable_value<int> *starting_player_idx)
        : unique_serializable(id),  // initialize the unique_serializable base-class
          _draw_pile(draw_pile),
          _discard_pile(discard_pile),
          _players(players),
          _is_started(is_started),
          _is_finished(is_finished),
          _current_player_idx(current_player_idx),
          _round_number(round_number),
          _starting_player_idx(starting_player_idx)
{ }

// DESERIALIZATION 
// returns a pointer to the new game_state
game_state* game_state::from_json(const rapidjson::Value &json) {
    // Make sure the json contains all required information
    if (json.HasMember("is_finished")
        && json.HasMember("is_started")
        && json.HasMember("current_player_idx")
        && json.HasMember("round_number")
        && json.HasMember("starting_player_idx")
        && json.HasMember("players")
        && json.HasMember("draw_pile")
        && json.HasMember("discard_pile"))
    {
        // deserialize all players
        std::vector<player*> deserialized_players;
        for (auto &serialized_player : json["players"].GetArray()) {
            deserialized_players.push_back(player::from_json(serialized_player.GetObject()));
        }
        // Invoke deserialization constructor
        return new game_state(unique_serializable::extract_id(json),   // extract base_params from JSON
                              draw_pile::from_json(json["draw_pile"].GetObject()),  // deserialize the draw_pile
                              discard_pile::from_json(json["discard_pile"].GetObject()),
                              deserialized_players,
                              serializable_value<bool>::from_json(json["is_started"].GetObject()),
                              serializable_value<bool>::from_json(json["is_finished"].GetObject()),
                              serializable_value<int>::from_json(json["current_player_idx"].GetObject()),
                              serializable_value<int>::from_json(json["round_number"].GetObject()),
                              serializable_value<int>::from_json(json["starting_player_idx"].GetObject()));
    } else {
        throw LamaException("Failed to deserialize game_state. Required entries were missing.");
    }
}
```

A similar scheme is applied in all other objects that inherit from `unique_serializable`. Namely, these are:
- `player`
- `hand`
- `card`
- `draw_pile`
- `discard_pile`
- `serializable_value`


### 4.4 GUI with wxWidgets

The GUI of the example project was built using the cross-platform GUI library [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/). In order to build a project using wxWidget elements, you will first need to install wxWidgets on your system (see Section 1.1 above). 

#### 4.4.1 Structure & Important Classes

Here is a list of the most important elements that you will need to create your GUI. This is just meant as an overview, you will need to look up their correct usage in wxWidget's [documentation](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0/index.html).

* __Application core__
    * __`wxIMPLEMENT_APP()`__: In order to properly interact with the operating system's GUI, wxWidgets takes over the control flow of your application. wxWidgets therefore has its own `main()` function, that you can reference with the macro `wxIMPLEMENT_APP(wxApp*)`.
    * __`wxApp`__: The core class of your application must inherit from the `wxApp` class. wxWidgets will call the `OnInit()` function when starting the application. You can find the example project's implementation in `src/client/app/Lama`.
* __Windows__
    * __`wxFrame`__: Each window of your application must inherit from the `wxFrame` class. The example project has one window which you can find here: `src/client/windows/GameWindow`
* __GUI elements__
    * __`wxPanel`__: Panels serve as containers for elements within a window. All panels must instantiate or inherit from the `wxPanel` class. A panel can contain one or more subpanels.
    * __`wxBoxSizer`__: Box sizers allow you to layout your panels within a window, either horizontally or vertically. By nesting box sizers, you can create complex layouts. Have a look at `src/client/panels/ConnectionPanel` for an example.
    * __`wxStaticText`__: This class displays text in your GUI.
    * __`wxButton`__: This class creates a clickable button in your GUI.
* __Pop-ups__
    * __`wxMessageBox()`__: You can use this function to display a small pop-up window with text in front of the your current main window. This is useful to display error or status messages.


#### 4.4.2 Events

Like in most GUI environments, objects in wxWidgets trigger __events__ when they are interacted with by the user. For instance, a button will trigger a `wxEVT_BUTTON` event when clicked. Similarly, a panel will trigger a `wxEVT_LEFT_UP` event when clicked. There are many other events that can be triggered - for example when a keyboard key is pressed, when a window is resized, or when the cursor moves over an element.

In order to make the GUI interactive, we must specify the effect of an event. The easiest way is to __bind__ an event to a lambda function. A lambda function is an unnamed function that can be used as an r-value. In C++, lambda functions have the following syntax:

```
[ external_variables... ]( function_parameters ... ) {
    function_body...
}

```

Here is an example which binds a lambda function to a button click event:

```
wxButton* myButton = new wxButton(parentPanel, wxID_ANY, "Click me!");
int myVariable = 42;
myButton->Bind(wxEVT_BUTTON, [myVariable](wxCommandEvent& event) {
    doSomething(myVariable, event);
});
```

In C++, we need to specify which variables from outside the lambda function's scope should be accessible within it. In the example above, `myVariable` is declared outside of the lambda function but is used by the `doSomething()` function call within the lambda function. We must therefore list `myVariable` within the square brackets at the beginning of the lambda function definition, in order to make it accessible from within the lambda function's scope. 

#### 4.4.3 Positioning

There are two ways to position elements (panels, button, etc.) within a parent element (window, panel): 
* __Using sizers__: In this approach, you will only need to provide an element's size, but not its position. You can then add that element to a sizer, which will then determine the element's position based on the sizer's predefined behavior. The most common sizer is `wxBoxSizer`, which allows you to position a set of elements one after the other, vertically or horizontally. You can also allow sizers to change the size of elements depending on the available space. This means you can have your GUI adapt to the size of the user's window and/or screen.
* __Using absolute positioning__: In this approach, you need to provide a position (as `wxPoint`) for each element. This position refers to the offset of the top-left corner of this element from the top-left corner of its parent. Using absolute positioning gives you much more control over the layout of your GUI. However, it is also much more work, as you will need to calculate the position for every single element. This is especially difficult if you want to adapt to changing window sizes.

#### 4.4.4 Classes for reuse

The example project provides two classes that you can reuse without changing anything:

* __`ImagePanel`__: This behaves like a regular panel, but shows an image in the background. You should use this to display any image you need for your GUI.
* __`InputField`__: This provides a user input field with a label in front of it. Use `getValue()` to get the user's input.
