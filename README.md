# Tichu - Team SALTÂ´D

# Tichu

This is a simple C++ implementation of the game "Tichu". The official game is published by Fata Morgana, you can find the official [German rules here](https://abacusspiele.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tichu_Regel.pdf) and the [English ones here](https://fatamorgana.ch/fatamorgana/tichu/english-rules).
The implementation features a client/server architecture for multiplayer scenarios.
It uses [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for the GUI, [sockpp](https://github.com/fpagliughi/sockpp) for the network interface, [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) for object serialization, and [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for the unit tests.

## Quick guide of the GUI

### 1. Login Screen

After starting the client, the first screen is going to be the login screen. Here every player enters:
- the **server address**
- the **server port**
- their **player name**
- their **preferred team** (Team A , Team B or a random selection)

When all details are entered, the player clicks on the *CONNECT*-button. If the player belongs to the first 3 players joining, they will be forwarded to the game lobby.

## 2. Compile instructions
This project should compile on Linux, Windows and MacOS. It was mainly tested on Ubuntu  20/22 and Windows 10/11.

## 2.1 Requirements:
- C++20
- OpenGL 3.2+
- CMake 3.15+

## 2.2 Build
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## 3. Generating Code Documentation with Doxygen

Before the code documentation can be generated, Doxygen needs to be installed. This can be done by cloning the [git repository](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) and following the [install instructions](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/install.html#google_vignette).
After Doxygen has been installed, navigate into the directory **doxygen_doc**. Post the command `doxygen Doxyfile`  into the terminal (Doxyfile refers to the file name within the directory). The Doxygen documentation will be generated within a folder named **html**.
