# Tichu - Team SALTÂ´D

# Tichu

This is a simple C++ implementation of the game "Tichu". The official game is published by Fata Morgana, you can find the official [German rules here](https://abacusspiele.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tichu_Regel.pdf) and the [English ones here](https://fatamorgana.ch/fatamorgana/tichu/english-rules).
The implementation features a client/server architecture for multiplayer scenarios.
It uses [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for the GUI, [sockpp](https://github.com/fpagliughi/sockpp) for the network interface, [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) for object serialization, and [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for the unit tests.

## Quick guide of the GUI

### 1. Login Screen

After starting the client, the first screen is going to be the login screen. Here every player enters:
- the **server address**
- the **server port**
- their **player name**
- their **preferred team** (Team A , Team B or a random selection)

When all details are entered, the player clicks on the *CONNECT*-button. If the player belongs to the first 3 players joining, they will be forwarded to the game lobby.
