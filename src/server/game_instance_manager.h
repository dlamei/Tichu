// The game_instance_manager only exists on the server side. It stores all currently active games and offers
// functionality to retrieve game instances by id and adding players to games.
// If a new player requests to join a game but no valid game_instance is available, then this class
// will generate a new game_instance and add it to the unordered_map of (active) game instances.
